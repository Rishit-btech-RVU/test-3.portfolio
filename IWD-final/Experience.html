                <p>I had the honor of being appointed Vice Captain of my house, a role that taught me valuable leadership skills, emphasizing responsibility and effective communication. I've led my school in basketball, drama, and debates, showcasing my dedication and inspiring my peers. These experiences have shaped my character and fueled my enthusiasm to contribute meaningfully to both academic and extracurricular pursuits. I'm eager to bring this commitment to any future endeavors, fostering a positive impact within the organization and beyond.</p>

                <p>I conducted a workshop at DPS Whitefield for 11th-grade students, covering topics such as black holes, time travel, and ISRO insights. The content for the workshop was derived from guest lectures delivered by ISRO representatives, arranged through the coordination of Exploring Science. The event was well-received, and the Physics Head of Department at the school expressed gratitude by providing a letter of thanks.</p>
